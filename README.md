# GenderClassification
In this repo i have used some of the basic scikit-learn algorithms to classify gender using height and weight features, for beginners to get started.


##OverView
The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

##Dependencies

Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
numpy (pip install numpy)
scipy (pip install scipy)
Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

python demo.py
